Create a few more blogs, either from the terminal or from the client. From the client, a user should be able to search a category and only those blogs with the searched category should come back when they click the search button.

Create a users table in the database. Make sure you give the table appropriate fields for what a user might need. Set up a sign up form that creates users from the client. 

Create a comments table in the database. Make sure you give the table appropriate fields for what a user might need.

Step 2: Instead of a search field, create a dropdown for the categories that has all categories listed.
